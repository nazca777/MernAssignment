# MernAssignment

A Mern stack project I made for LaunchPartner.

With this app you can sign up with email and password and build a profile with a name and description which you can also edit. You can then view the profile data of all other users in the database and see their names and descriptions.

The assignment is almost exactly what was asked of me, the only short coming is that I unfortunately was not able to add file
uploading and saving as I ran out of time. Also to save time I used Materialize CSS to build a UI that doesnt look bad so that I can focus on the functionality.

In a real world project I would take extra steps such as form and error handling as well as hashing passwords.
